#  - KeepBibtex, to keep the citation key from the downloaded .bib file
#  - FirstAuthorYearTitle, to use the first author's last name, the year, and the first word in title (e.g., tomescu2019transparency)
#     + If the paper has one author only, uses the first four letters in that author's last name
#  - InitialsShortYear, to use the initials of the first 4 authors + the year; if more than 4 authors, uses the first 3 authors' initials, a plus (+) sign, and the last 2 digits in the year (e.g., TD17, TCZ+19)
