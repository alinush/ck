CK
==

A command-line tool for managing your bibliography (i.e., `.bib` files and `.pdf` files) across multiple machines using Dropbox.

Features:

 - add papers, sorted by citation key, to Dropbox
 - easily open any paper given its citation key
 - organize papers by tagging them
 - generate a full `.bib` file of all your papers
 - export papers with a particular tag

Setup
-----

    pip install click pyperclip beautifulsoup4 appdirs fake-useragent bibtexparser lxml

Fill in `ck.config` and put it in your [user_config_dir folder](https://pypi.org/project/appdirs/).

For auto tag-suggesting, you can install pdfgrep (optional):
    
    apt install pdfgrep # Ubuntu/Debian
    brew install pdfgrep # mac

To install bash auto-completion, run

    source bash_completion.d/ck

How to use
----------

    # add a paper to your library given a paywall URL (e.g., ACM DL, SpringerLink, IEEEXplore)
    # or an eprint url (e.g., IACR eprint)
    ck add <paper-url> <citation-key>

    # add a bib file to your library without a PDF
    ck open <citation-key>.bib
    # ...and edit the .bib file and save it

    # open a paper's PDF
    ck open <citation-key>
    ck open <citation-key>.pdf

    # open a paper's .bib file
    ck open <citation-key>.bib

    # tag the paper with <tag> (or enter tag manually from keyboard)
    ck tag <citation-key> [<tag>]

    # search all your .bib files and print matching papers' citation keys
    ck search <query>

Best practices
--------------

**Q:** How to deal with multiple _published_ versions of the same paper (eprint, conference, journal)?  
_A:_ Have each version as a different CK, since it might contain additional info that needs to be cited.

TODOs
-----

 - `ck tag/untag/genbib/copypdfs` autocompletion of tags
 - figure out how to have a `setup.py` that installs this thing
    + add a `requirements.txt` too
 - if PDFs are not available from publisher, try sci-hub.tw: see [python example here](https://gist.github.com/mpratt14/df20f09a06ba4249f3fad0776610f39d)
 - might want separate `updatebib` and `updatepdf` commands, to support adding the PDF and .bib file from different locations. Then, `ck add` can just call both of them, with `overwrite=false`
    - If called individually, they will leave the library in an inconsistent state, so the user should be warned (since either PDF or .bib file might be missing)
    + URL handler should be split into a `download_pdf` and a `download_bib`, so we can call them separately in `updatebib/pdf`
        + this is useful when PDFs are paywalled, but we still want the .bib
 - Cryptology ePrint updater: need it to update papers to their latest versions
    - `ck` should run this once a day
    + should move old paper to `CK<year>.<ckdateadded>.pdf` (make sure no naming conflicts)
 - tools for making the .bib files consistent
    + titles should have double brackets
    + same conference shouldn't have different names
    + author names should always be separated by ' and '
    - similar or incomplete author names
 - `ck` command
    - `list` subcommand
        - display associated file info
            - nopdf
            - nobib
            - md
            - any other files (e.g., ABC19.slides.pdf)
        - add sort-by options
            - need sort by most recently added (with date & time displayed)
        - list all conferences across papers
        - when invoked without recursion, tell user what other subtags are there in the current subdir?
    - `open` subcommand
        - add support for various associated files: .bib, .html, .md, .notes.\[0-9\]\*.pdf, .slides.pdf, .etc
        - if you type in a partial citation key, should list all matches
            - if just one match, should just open it, displaying a warning that it only partially matched so as to not train you to use the wrong CK
        - if you type an ambiguous citation key (lowercase / uppercase), maybe you should be prompted for what to open, because there won't be many matches.
    - `untag` subcommand
        + right now, if we only have a `.bib` file without any PDFs, `untag` will not detect any untagged papers. how to handle?
